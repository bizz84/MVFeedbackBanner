**MVFeedbackBanner** is a plug and play component that can be used to easily integrate a simple flow to ask the user for feedback or to rate the app.

It has been inspired by [this Medium story](https://medium.com/budi-brain/designing-in-app-survey-6163304e88dd#.kata5zlku) about designing an in-app survey.

## Features

* Super easy integration with **Interface Builder** or **programmatically**.
* **IBDesignable** support
* Customisable texts and background colors

## Screen flows

An out of the box controller is provided with two possible flows:

**Are you enjoying this app?**

* **Yes**: Great! Let other know what you think of this app
	* **No thanks**: Dismiss
	* **Rate App**: Open App Store page
* **No**: Could you tell me what happened?
	* **No**: Dismiss
	* **Yes**: Open feedback form / email
